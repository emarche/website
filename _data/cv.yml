    - title: Ph.D.
      institution: University of Verona, Verona, Italy
      year: 10/2018 - 03/2022 
      work_title: Enhancing Exploration and Safety in Deep Reinforcement Learning
      abstract: My Ph.D. research focused on tackling two fundamental challenges for real-world applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL); exploration and safety. I developed algorithms for (safe) Deep Reinforcement Learning that have been applied in robotics and multi-agent tasks. In particular, my research proposed novel population-based approaches based on Evolutionary Algorithms to enhance exploration, and the use of Formal Verification tools to foster safety.
