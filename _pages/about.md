I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/enrico-marchesini">Khoury College of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</a> advised by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/chris-amato/">Prof. Christopher Amato</a>, in the <a href="https://llpr.ccs.neu.edu">Lab for Learning and Planning in Robotics (LLPR)</a>. Two weeks before joining LLPR in April 2022, I received my Ph.D. at the University of Verona, advised by <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli">Prof. Alessandro Farinelli</a>. 

My <strong>research interests</strong> are driven by the impact that Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) could have in real-world domains, where effective <em>exploration</em>, <em>safety</em>, and <em>asynchronous execution</em> are key requirements for autonomous learning agents. Hence, I focus on developing Deep RL algorithms aimed at tackling these fundamental challenges in simulation, <em>multi-agent</em> systems, and realistic applications. I am currently working on safe population-based RL, with a particular emphasis on asynchronous Multi-Agent RL. 

Outside of work, I spend time climbing and hiking.
