&emsp;**August**
- Our preprint <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15381'>“On Stateful Value Factorization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”</a> addresses an important problem that has been overlooked in the MARL community for more than half a decade! 

&emsp;**June**
- Our preprint <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08315'>“Improving Policy Optimization via ε-Retrain”</a> investigates how to improve policy optimization methods using restart distributions and is out! 

&emsp;**January**
- Our paper “Enumerating Safe Regions in Deep Neural Networks with Provable Probabilistic Guarantees” has been accepted at <a href='https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/'>AAAI 2024</a>. Congratulations to <a href='https://lmarza.github.io'>Luca Marzari</a> for leading the project! What a great start to 2024! 
- Another collaboration with the colleagues from <a href='https://oregonstate.edu'>Oregon State University</a>,  <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/alp-aydeniz'>Alp Aydeniz</a>, and <a href='https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/'>Kagan Tumer</a> has been accepted at AAMAS 2024. Check out our abstract “Entropy Seeking Constrained Multiagent Reinforcement Learning” during the conference in May!
